**1** The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of
Abraham:

**2** Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his 
brothers.

**3** Judah  Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot
begot Ram.

**4** Ram begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon.

**5** Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse,

**6** and Jesse begot David the king.  David the king begot Solomon by her _who
had been the wife_ of Uriah.

**7** Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa.

**8** Asa begot Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah.

**9** Uzziah begot Jotham, Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah.

**10** Hezekia begot Manasseh, Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.

**11** Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers about the time they were carried
away to Babylon.

**12** And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and 
Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel.

**13** Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor.

**14** Azor begot Zadok, Zadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud.

**15** Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob.

**16** And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who 
is called the Christ.

**17** So all the generations from Abraham to David *are* fourteen generations, 
from David until the captivity in Babylon *are* fourteen generations, and from
 the captivity in Babylon until the Christ *are* fourteen generations.

**18** Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows:  After His mother Mary was found with child of the Holy Spirit.

**19** Then Joseph her husband, being a just *man*, and not wanting to make 
her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.

**20** But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord 
appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to 
take to you Mary your wife, for that which is concieved in her is of the Holy 
Spirit.

**21** "And she will bring forth a Son, an you shall call His name JESUS, for 
He will save His people from their sins."

**22** So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the 
Lord through the prophet, saying:

**23** *"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they 
shall call His name Immanuel,"* which is translated, "God is with us."

**24** Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord 
commanded him and took to him his wife,

**25** and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son.  And 
he called His Name JESUS.

**1** Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,

**2** saying, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him."

**3** When Herod the king heard _this_, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

**4** And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.

**5** So they said to him, "In Bethelehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:

**6**	_"'But you, Bethelehem, in the land of Judah,
	Are not the least among the rules of Judah;
	For out of you shall come a Ruler
	Who will shepherd My people Israel.'"_

**7** Then Herod, when he had secretly called the wise men, determined from 
them what time the star appeared.

**8** And he sent them to Bethelehem and said, "Go and search carefully for 
the young Child, and when you have found *Him*, bring back word to me, that 
I may come and worship Him also.

**9** When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which 
they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over 
where the young Child was.

**10** when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.

**11** And when they had come into the house, they saw the young Child with 
Mary His mother, and fell down and worshiped Him.  And when they had opened 
their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.

**12** Then, being divinely warned in a dream that they should not return to 
Herod, they departed for their own country another way.

**13** Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to 
Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, take the young Child and His mother, flee 
to Egypt, and stay there until I bring you word; for Herod will seek the 
young Child to destroy Him."

**14** When he arose, he took the young Child and His mother by night and 
departed for Egypt,

**15** and was there until the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled 
which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, *"Out of Egypt 
I called My Son."*

**16** Then Herod, when he saw taht he was deceived by the wise men, was
exceedingly angry; and he sent forth and put to death all the male children 
who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, 
according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.

**17** Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the propet, saying:

**18** *"A voice was heard in Ramah, Lamentation, weeping and great mourning, 
Rachel weeping for for her children, Refusing to be comforted, Because they 
are no more."*

**19** Now when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a 
dream to Joseph in Egypt,

**20** saying, "Arise, take the young Child and His mother, and go to the land 
of Israel, for those who sought the young Child's life are dead."

**21** Then he arose, took the young Child and His mother, and came into the 
land of Israel.

**22** But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of 
his father Herod, he was afraid to go there.  And being warned by God in a 
dream, he turned aside into the region of Galilee.

**23** And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that it might be 
fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, "He shall be called a Nazarene."
