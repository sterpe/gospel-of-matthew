**1** The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of
Abraham:

**2** Abraham begot Isaac, Isaac begot Jacob, and Jacob begot Judah and his 
brothers.

**3** Judah  Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez begot Hezron, and Hezron begot
begot Ram.

**4** Ram begot Amminadab, Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon.

**5** Salmon begot Boaz by Rahab, Boaz begot Obed by Ruth, Obed begot Jesse,

**6** and Jesse begot David the king.  David the king begot Solomon by her _who
had been the wife_ of Uriah.

**7** Solomon begot Rehoboam, Rehoboam begot Abijah, and Abijah begot Asa.

**8** Asa begot Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat begot Joram, and Joram begot Uzziah.

**9** Uzziah begot Jotham, Jotham begot Ahaz, and Ahaz begot Hezekiah.

**10** Hezekia begot Manasseh, Manasseh begot Amon, and Amon begot Josiah.

**11** Josiah begot Jeconiah and his brothers about the time they were carried
away to Babylon.

**12** And after they were brought to Babylon, Jeconiah begot Shealtiel, and 
Shealtiel begot Zerubbabel.

**13** Zerubbabel begot Abiud, Abiud begot Eliakim, and Eliakim begot Azor.

**14** Azor begot Zadok, Zadok begot Achim, and Achim begot Eliud.

**15** Eliud begot Eleazar, Eleazar begot Matthan, and Matthan begot Jacob.

**16** And Jacob begot Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who 
is called the Christ.

**17** So all the generations from Abraham to David *are* fourteen generations, 
from David until the captivity in Babylon *are* fourteen generations, and from
 the captivity in Babylon until the Christ *are* fourteen generations.

**18** Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows:  After His mother Mary was found with child of the Holy Spirit.

**19** Then Joseph her husband, being a just *man*, and not wanting to make 
her a public example, was minded to put her away secretly.

**20** But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord 
appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to 
take to you Mary your wife, for that which is concieved in her is of the Holy 
Spirit.

**21** "And she will bring forth a Son, an you shall call His name JESUS, for 
He will save His people from their sins."

**22** So all this was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the 
Lord through the prophet, saying:

**23** *"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and bear a Son, and they 
shall call His name Immanuel,"* which is translated, "God is with us."

**24** Then Joseph, being aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord 
commanded him and took to him his wife,

**25** and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn Son.  And 
he called His Name JESUS.

**1** Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the kking, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem,

**2** saying, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East and have come to worship Him."

**3** When Herod the king heard _this_, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem wwith him.

**4** And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people together, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.

**5** So they said to him, "In Bethelehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:

**6**	_'But you, Bethelehem, in the land of Judah,
	Are not the least among the rules of Judah;
	For out of you shall come a Ruler
	Who will shepherd My people Israel.'"_
